**Version 1.0.3 - January 27, 2026 - FHIR R4 Validation and UUID Corrections**

Changes to both supplier-api-spec.yaml and home-test-supplier-api.yaml:

1. Fixed UUID Validation Issues in Observation Resources
   - **supplier-api-spec.yaml**: Changed FHIRObservation.id example from "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" to "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
       - Reason: Observation ID conflicted with ServiceRequest ID causing reference validation errors
       - Ensures unique UUIDs across all resources to prevent FHIR reference mismatches
   - **home-test-supplier-api.yaml**: Observation.id example already correctly set to "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
   - **supplier-api-spec.yaml**: Updated FHIRBundleSearchsetObservations.entry.fullUrl example to "urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
       - Ensures Bundle fullUrl matches the Observation resource ID
       - Critical for FHIR Bundle validation where fullUrl must reference the correct resource


---

**Version 1.0.4 - January 27, 2026 - Business-Critical Required Fields (FHIR Profiling)**

Changes to both supplier-api-spec.yaml and home-test-supplier-api.yaml:
Added Required Fields for Business Operations (FHIR Constrained Profile)

1. FHIRServiceRequest Required Fields Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
   - Made `contained` required (minItems: 1) - Patient demographics are mandatory for order fulfillment
   - Made contained Patient properties required:
     - `resourceType` - Required for FHIR resource type identification
     - `id` - Required for contained resource reference (#patient-1)
     - `name` - Required (patient identification for order processing)
     - `telecom` - Required (contact information for delivery and follow-up)
     - `address` - Required (shipping address for test kit delivery)

2. FHIRObservation Required Fields Added (both APIs)
   - Made `basedOn` required - Links Observation to originating ServiceRequest (critical for order tracking)
   - Made `valueCodeableConcept` required - The actual test result must be present (core purpose of Observation)

3. FHIRTask Required Fields Added (home-test-supplier-api.yaml only)
   - Made `identifier` required - Essential for tracking order status across systems

4. FHIR Datatype Required Fields Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
   - FHIRHumanName: Made `family` required - Last name is mandatory for patient identification
   - FHIRContactPoint: Made `value` required - Contact method is useless without actual contact value
   - FHIRAddress: Made `line` and `postalCode` required - Minimum address information for UK deliveries

5. Patient Telecom Cardinality Constraint Added (supplier-api-spec.yaml only)
   - Made Patient.telecom `minItems: 2` - Requires at least 2 contact points
   - Updated description to clarify both phone and email are required
   - **Business Rationale**: Both phone (for delivery contact) and email are essential for order fulfillment and customer communication
   - **Implementation Note**: Application validation should verify one telecom has `system: 'phone'` and one has `system: 'email'`


**Version 1.0.5 - March 10, 2026 - Example and Required Field Corrections**

Changes to home-test-supplier-api.yaml:

1. Fixed basedOn Example Values
- FHIRObservation.basedOn: Changed items from bare `$ref` to `allOf` with context-specific example, replacing inherited `Organization/SUP001` example with correct `ServiceRequest/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- FHIRTask.basedOn: Same fix applied - updated description to "Reference to the ServiceRequest this task fulfills" and added correct ServiceRequest example

2. Added Required Fields to FHIRTask
- Made `for` required - Patient beneficiary must be identified on every status update
- Made `lastModified` required - Timestamp of the status change is mandatory for audit and ordering

Changes to examples/fhir/task_update_dispatched.example.json:

3. Fixed task_update_dispatched Example
- Corrected `status` from `"dispatched"` (invalid FHIR value) to `"in-progress"`
- Added missing required `intent` field with value `"order"`
- Added missing required `for` field referencing `Patient/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`
- Added missing required `lastModified` field with value `"2025-11-04T10:35:00Z"`
- Added `use: "official"` to identifier entry for consistency with schema example
