# HomeTest Supplier Integration Framework

A lightweight framework for defining and validating supplier integration contracts for HomeTest-style integrations. The repo is structured to make it easy to version, review, and automate checks against schemas and contractual changes over time.

## What’s in this repository

- **`schemas/`** — Version-controlled schema definitions that describe the integration contract(s).
- **`schemas/CHANGELOG.md`** — Human-readable record of notable changes between releases.

## Typical use cases

- **Contract-first integrations:** agree a stable interface with suppliers using schemas as the source of truth.
- **Validation in CI/CD:** automatically validate payloads/artifacts against the schemas.
- **Change control & governance:** track breaking vs non-breaking changes via PR review + changelog + versioning.

## Getting started

### Clone the repository

```text
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd hometest-supplier-integration-framework
```

## Working with schemas

### Where to put new schemas

- Add or update schema files under `schemas/`.
- Keep schema changes **small and reviewable**—prefer incremental PRs to large rewrites.

### Recommended workflow for changing contracts

1. **Create a branch** describing the change.
2. **Update schemas** in [`schemas/`](./schemas/).
3. **Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](./schemas/changelog.md)** with:
    - what changed,
    - why it changed,
    - impact (breaking/non-breaking),
    - any migration notes.
4. Open a PR and use the PR template to capture:
    - test evidence,
    - rollout/migration plan,
    - stakeholder sign-off if required.


## Testing

### FHIR example validation

The FHIR example resources in [`examples/fhir/`](./examples/fhir) are validated against the FHIR specification using the [HL7 FHIR Validator CLI](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator).

Validation runs automatically in CI on every push and pull request via [`.github/workflows/validate-fhir-examples.yml`](./.github/workflows/validate-fhir-examples.yml). Results are posted as a comment on pull requests.

To run validation locally, see [`tests/fhir-examples/README.md`](./tests/fhir-examples/README.md) for prerequisites, usage, and how to interpret the output.

## Contributing
